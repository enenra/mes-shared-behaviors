# MES Shared Behaviors
MES Shared Behaviors or MSB is a behavior library for Modular Encounters Systems (MES) to allow Space Engineers modders to easily create complex encounters, while not having to set up that logic by themselves.

## How to use
Usage of MSB requires knowledge of the creation of MES config files. While it makes the creation of encounter mods much easier, it still requires users to know their way around setting up their own side and being able to understand the way MSB works enough to use it.

Fundamentally, we differentiate between dynamic and static encounters. Static being ones consisting of static grids, dynamic being ones that move about.
